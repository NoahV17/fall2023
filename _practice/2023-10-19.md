1. Use your github-inclass repo to create a scenario where you can fix a problem using a git command from the [patching or debugging section of the docs](https://git-scm.com/docs). Create a log of what you did using the history or git log into a file {index}`gitstory.md`. If you have a project in another class or another badge in this class that causes you to use one in a real scenario, that can count.  If not, for example, you could create a "bug" and then use bisect to find it.  
2. Create {index}`tagtypes.md`  with the template below.
Include an experiment that shows which if either type of tag creates a new git object. There are two types, try creating one of each a lightwight tag (provide only the tag name- what we did in class) and an annotated (provide a name and a message with `-m`).  Determine  many of the tags in the course website are annotated vs lightweight using what  you learned about how tags are represented and `git cat-file` to see which is which. 


```
# Tags

<!-- short defintion/description in your own words of what a tag is and what it is for -->


## Comparing tag types 

<!-- include your experiment terminal history  and interpretation -->

## Inspecting tags

Course website tags by type: 
- annoted:
- lightweight:
